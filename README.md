# Python Logging

Logging is a crucial aspect of software development that allows you to record and track various information during the execution of your program. The `logging` module in Python provides a flexible and powerful way to incorporate logging into your applications.

## Overview

The `logging` module enables you to:

- Capture log information at different levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
- Configure log formatting to include timestamps, log levels, and custom messages.
- Handle exceptions and log traceback information.
- Easily integrate logging into different parts of your application.

## How to Use

### Basic Configuration

To get started with logging, you can configure it using the `basicConfig` function. This sets the logging level and format for the entire application:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

#You can use various logging functions (debug, info, warning, error, critical) to log messages in different parts of your code. For example:

def example_function():
    logging.info("This is an informational message.")
    try:
        # Your code here
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred: {e}", exc_info=True)
```

### Use Cases
Debugging: Logging is invaluable during the development and debugging process. Use the DEBUG level to log detailed information about the program's state.

Monitoring: Log important events or warnings during the program's execution to monitor its behavior.

Exception Handling: Log errors and exceptions to identify and diagnose issues in production.
